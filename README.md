# Sample code for the 'Solve the Jumble' blog post

The solution is outlined in this blog post: https://vandine.biz/blog/solve-the-jumble

The repository includes:

- **puzzlewords.sqlite**, which is a SQLite version of the word list and sorted 'key' as described in the blog post.
- **wordlistsql.py**, a Python 3 script to create the PuzzleWords database and table from a text listing of words.
- **jumble.php**, a PHP script that provides the HTML entry form and solving function needed to submit a scrambled word and get an answer.
- A Python 3 version of the script that can be run from the command line
